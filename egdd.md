## Elevator Pitch
Note (for later): To avoid beating the game by placing cards and 'attacking face,' the opponent should have taunt cards (maybe called 'hazard' in that they need to be neutralized/attacked first).Spell card called 'water' could reduce the acid/base's concentration by a half, but it's bad safety practice to add water to an acid/base (you should add acids/bases to water), so it would have to be more like a trap card in that it affects the next acid/base card the other player plays. In the current system I have in my head, the damage and health of a card is the same, which seems odd in terms of card game, but normal in terms of chemistry. Frankly, I don't see it too much of a problem since it's an educational game, not an esports game. OR the cards have stats of 'moles' and 'liters'. When the card attacks another, the moles are subtracted and the liters are added. Only the molarity matters when attacking face, and it's up to the player to calculate the molarity of the cards. In short, card vs. card, moles matter in a reaction and card vs face, molarity matters for damage.

*A one sentence pitch for your game. Pretend that your were pitching your game to a executive going to the elevator. You have less than 60 Seconds. Check [this resource](http://www.gameacademy.com/perfecting-indie-games-elevator-pitch/) for more information.*
This is a turn-based card game. The player plays against a bot and attempts to defeat the enemy by attacking it with cards they place down. These cards are either an acid or base. The cards contain stats of molarity and moles. Molarity is the damage done to the player if it attack a player directly. Moles is the card's health as well as the damage done to other cards.

## Influences (Brief)

- *Hearthstone*:
  - Medium: *Video Game*
  - Explanation: *Hearthstone is a turn-based card game in which the player fights another with cards and spells, each with varying hitpoints and damage. This game is similar to this as it will be a turn-based card game. But rather than health, cards will have moles for health.*
- *Legends of Runeterra*:
  - Medium: *Video Game*
  - Explanation: *Legends of Runeterra is a turn-based card game in which the player fights another with cards and spells. This game has a similar feel to it as it is also a turn-based card game with the goal of defeating the enemy.*
- *Honors General Chemistry 111*:
  - Medium: *UD classroom lecture*
  - Explanation: *In Ethan's honors general chemistry class, one topic that was reviewed was limiting reactants and acid-base reactions. Combining these two, this game involves those topics and attempts to appeal to students learning chemistry.*

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

*Give a very high-level description of any core gameplay mechanics*

- *Each player starts with 4 cards in their hand and draws one from their deck every turn.*
- *Play cards from your hand by clicking and dragging them onto the board, which has seven card spaces for each player. When the card is placed down, it cannot attack until the player's next turn.*
- *Click and drag a card from your side of the board to a card on the other side of the board to attack/neutralize it.*
- *Acids can only attack bases and vice versa. Acids cannot attack acids and bases cannot attack bases.*
- *During an attack between two cards, each card takes damage based on the moles neutralized in the reaction aka the other card's moles. Health points are recalculated and updated for each card. If it's health (moles) is less than or equal to 0, it's destroyed.*
- *Attacking the other player with a card deals damage based on the card's molarity*
- *When a player's health reaches 0, they lose*

# Learning Aspects

## Learning Domains

*Briefly list any and all of the disciplines and learning domains for this subject.*

*Introductory Chemistry*

## Target Audiences

*Who are your learners?*

*Novice chemists with a little prior knowledge in chemistry*
*Appropriate for middle school and high school kids and perhaps adults who are young at heart*

## Target Contexts

*Describe what kinds of formal and informal learning contexts this will be used in (e.g., courses, k-12 computer labs during free time).*

*This would be assigned as supplementary practice in a course teaching introductory chemistry, specifically during the unit on acid/base chemistry, which often comes after limiting reactants.*

## Learning Objectives

*Remember, Learning Objectives are NOT simply topics. They are statements of observable behavior that a learner can do after the learning experience. You cannot observe someone "understanding" or "knowing" something.*

- *Identify limiting reactants*: *By the end of the lesson, students will be able to identify the limiting and excess reactant in an acid-base reaction.*
- *Calculate limiting reactants*: *By the end of the lesson, students will be able to calculate the moles of an acid or base used in a chemical reaction and determine how many moles are left in excess.*
- *Calculate moles from molarity*: *By the end of the lesson, students will be able to calculate the moles of an acid or base given it's molarity and volume.*

## Prerequisite Knowledge

*What do they need to know prior to trying this game?*

- *Prior to the game, players need to be able to define molarity and identify its units.*
- *Prior to the game, players need to be able to explain the reaction between a strong acid and strong base.*

## Assessment Measures

*Describe how the learning will be assessed, e.g., pre/post multiple-choice test, or SAT, or some other instrument.*
*A short pre-test and matching post-test will be designed to assess student learning*

*If proposing a new instrument, briefly and concisely list some example assessment questions.*
- *Given the number of moles of an acid and base, determine the limiting reactant and how much excess reactant is left over.*
- *Given the number of moles of an acid and base, determine the number of moles of a salt and water are formed.*

# What sets this project apart?

*Give some reasons why this game is not like every other game out there. Whether the learning objective is unique, the gameplay mechanics are new, or what. You should persuade the reader that your game is novel and worthy of development. Consider arguments that would be persuasive to a Venture Capitalist, Teacher, or Researcher. These might be focused on learning needs, too.*

- *Most introductory activities regarding acid-base reactions and limiting reactants involve worksheets or labwork, this is a (hopefully) fun card game.*
- *The gameplay of adding an acid/base to the water trap card follows lab safety in that you should always mix those two in that order and not the other way around.*
- *The gameplay of molarity doing damage to player resembles the fact that higher concentrations of acids and bases generally have stronger potency.*

# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes

## Player Interaction Pattern

*Describe how people play your game, how many players are involved at once, how they interact with the system works, etc.*

*This is a game for one person. They draw cards, play them, and use them to attack the enemy and their cards.*

## Player Modes

*Your game has one or more player modes. Describe each discrete mode, considering things like menus too. Generally describe the transitions between modes too.*

- *Single-player*: *You repeatedly draw, play, and attack cards until the enemy is defeated.*

# Gameplay Objectives

- *Neutralize enemy cards*:
    - Description: *When your moles of acid/base is greater than the enemy's base/acid, their card is neutralized, leaving less enemies on the board.*
    - Alignment: *Learning to predict the outcome of reactions and know which reactant is left over in excess aligns with the learning objectives.*
- *Attack the enemy base*:
    - Description: *Beat the enemy by attacking it with cards. When its health reaches 0, you win.*
    - Alignment: *You have to go through all the learninig objectives of being able to calculate and predict the outcomes of reactions to beat the enemy.*

# Procedures/Actions

*Describe the control scheme and what actions a user can take in the game.*

*You can drag cards from your hand to the battlefield -- this card can't attack until your next turn. You can drag cards on the battlefield from your side to a card on the other side to attack it. You can also drag cards on the battlefield from your side to the enemy directly to attack them.*

# Rules

*What resources are available to the player that they make use of?  How does this affect gameplay? How are these resources finite?*

# Objects/Entities

*What other things are in the world that you need to design? These may or may not directly translate to actual objects and classes.*
