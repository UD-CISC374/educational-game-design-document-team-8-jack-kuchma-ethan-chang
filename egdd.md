# NaCl/NaOH The base is under a salt - if you don't get this, retake general chem :D

## Elevator Pitch
Note (for later): To avoid beating the game by placing cards and 'attacking face,' the opponent should have taunt cards (maybe called 'hazard' in that they need to be neutralized/attacked first).Spell card called 'water' could reduce the acid/base's concentration by a half, but it's bad safety practice to add water to an acid/base (you should add acids/bases to water), so it would have to be more like a trap card in that it affects the next acid/base card the other player plays. In the current system I have in my head, the damage and health of a card is the same, which seems odd in terms of card game, but normal in terms of chemistry. Frankly, I don't see it too much of a problem since it's an educational game, not an esports game. OR the cards have stats of 'moles' and 'liters'. When the card attacks another, the moles are subtracted and the liters are added. Only the molarity matters when attacking face, and it's up to the player to calculate the molarity of the cards. In short, card vs. card, moles matter in a reaction and card vs face, molarity matters for damage.

## Influences (Brief)

- *Hearthstone*:
  - Medium: *Video Game*
  - Explanation: *Hearthstone is a turn-based card game in which the player fights another with cards and spells, each with varying hitpoints and damage. This game is similar to this as it will be a turn-based card game. But rather than health, cards will have moles for health.*
- *Legends of Runeterra*:
  - Medium: *Video Game*
  - Explanation: *Legends of Runeterra is a turn-based card game in which the player fights another with cards and spells. This game has a similar feel to it as it is also a turn-based card game with the goal of defeating the enemy.*
- *Honors General Chemistry 111*:
  - Medium: *UD classroom lecture*
  - Explanation: *In Ethan's honors general chemistry class, one topic that was reviewed was limiting reactants and acid-base reactions. Combining these two, this game involves those topics and attempts to appeal to students learning chemistry.*

## Core Gameplay Mechanics (Brief)

*Give a very high-level description of any core gameplay mechanics*

- *Each player starts with 4 cards in their hand and draws one from their deck every turn.*
- *Play cards from your hand by clicking and dragging them onto the board, which has seven card spaces for each player*
- *Click and drag a card from your side of the board to a card on the other side of the board to attack/neutralize it.*
- *Acids can only attack bases and vice versa. Acids cannot attack acids and bases cannot attack bases.*
- *During an attack between two cards, each card takes damage based on the moles neutralized in the reaction. Health points is determined by how many moles of H+ or OH- ions left in the acid or base, respectively.*
- *Attacking the other player with a card deals damage based on the card's molarity* (Consider changing 'molarity' to something else)
- *When a player's health reaches 0, they lose*

# Learning Aspects

## Learning Domains

*Briefly list any and all of the disciplines and learning domains for this subject.*

*Introductory Chemistry*

## Target Audiences

*Who are your learners?*

*Novice chemists with a little prior knowledge in chemistry*
*Appropriate for middle school and high school kids and perhaps adults who are young at heart*

## Target Contexts

*Describe what kinds of formal and informal learning contexts this will be used in (e.g., courses, k-12 computer labs during free time).*

*This would be assigned as supplementary practice in a course teaching introductory chemistry, specifically during the unit on acid/base chemistry, which often comes after limiting reactants.*

## Learning Objectives

*Remember, Learning Objectives are NOT simply topics. They are statements of observable behavior that a learner can do after the learning experience. You cannot observe someone "understanding" or "knowing" something.*

- *Identify limiting reactants*: *By the end of the lesson, students will be able to identify the limiting and excess reactant in an acid-base reaction.*
- *Calculate limiting reactants*: *By the end of the lesson, students will be able to calculate the moles of an acid or base used in a chemical reaction and determine how many moles are left in excess.*
- *Calculate moles from molarity*: *By the end of the lesson, students will be able to calculate the moles of an acid or base given it's molarity and volume.*
- *Short Name*: *Formal Learning Objective #3*

## Prerequisite Knowledge

*What do they need to know prior to trying this game?*

- *Prerequisite Learning Objective #1*
- *Prerequisite Learning Objective #2*

## Assessment Measures

*Describe how the learning will be assessed, e.g., pre/post multiple-choice test, or SAT, or some other instrument.*

*If proposing a new instrument, briefly and concisely list some example assessment questions.*

# What sets this project apart?

*Give some reasons why this game is not like every other game out there. Whether the learning objective is unique, the gameplay mechanics are new, or what. You should persuade the reader that your game is novel and worthy of development. Consider arguments that would be persuasive to a Venture Capitalist, Teacher, or Researcher. These might be focused on learning needs, too.*

- *etc.*

# Player Interaction Patterns and Modes

## Player Interaction Pattern

# Story and Gameplay

## Presentation of Rules

*Briefly describe how the player will learn the gameplay mechanics. Avoid using walls of text, since people will not read them. Think instead of natural ways of teaching mechanics iteratively and slowly.*

## Storyboarding

*Go into as much detail as needs be to visually convey the Dynamics of your game. Be detailed. Create storyboards and freeze frame images that concisely capture important key elements of your game.
